# Wells

A `Well` represents the coordinates of a well in a plate of a given format
(by default, 384).  Given these coordinates, the functions `Row()` and `Column()`
extract the row and column coordinates as letters and numbers respectively.
Note that plate formats names are characters, not numbers.

```{r wells}
well <- Well("C14")
well |> Row()
Column(well)
```

Because the well coordinates come with a plate format, it is possible to
determine where is the "next" well

```{r next_wells}
nextWell(well)
```

# Plates

A plate object represents a physical mutliwell plate that may be filled with
liquids.  In addition to its format, it has a _dead volume_ property that is
used to calculate when it is not possible anymore to draw liquid from a well,
and a _maximal volume_ property that is used to to calculate when it is not
possible anymore to add liquid to a well.  These properties can be left
unspecified when the plate representation is for theoretical purposes only.  All
volumes are expressed in nanoliters.

```{r plates}
Plate("96", deadVolume = 1e4, maxVolume = 1e5)
Plate("384")
```

# For developers

## Conventions

 - Class names start with capital letters.
 - Constructor functions have the same name as the class.
