A `Well` represents the coordinates of a well in a plate of a given format
(by default, 384).  Given these coordinates, the functions `Row()` and `Column()`
extract the row and column coordinates as letters and numbers respectively.
Note that plate formats names are characters, not numbers.

```{r wells}
well <- Well(well = "C14", plateFormat = "384")
well |> Row()
Column(well)
```

```{r next_wells}
nextWell(well)
```


# For developers

## Conventions

 - Class names start with capital letters.
 - Constructor functions have the same name as the class.
